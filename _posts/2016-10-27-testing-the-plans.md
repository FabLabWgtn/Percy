![tempering loaf tin]({{site.url}}{{site.imageurl}}IMG_20161027_193126.jpg)

This week was a bit of a slow night. Everyone was slightly tired after busy days at work.

Discussion around B plan if the pipe from the tempering tank cools the chocolate before it reaches the org assembly.


#### Tempering Tank:
**Wheel**, Need to be similar size and radius to the Vessel

**Vessel**, Needs to have a curved side to prevent build up.
narrower vessel to reduce volume of chocolate needed.

**Scraper**, move hole placement and change 45 degree angle.
Hose mounting system, layer up acrylic to make press fit receiver.

Sketch up and design a mount for all of the above.

**Org assembly**,
Replace with printed part with receiver for tube from tempering tank.


To do:
Get biscuit tin  
CAD up new Org assembly
