A one wet wellington winter, a group of makers got together to tinker with machines and chocolate. 

#### The Makers
The Wellington Makers Meetup is a group that is open to all. It started with the goal of establishing a community of makers in Wellington. Check out the group here, maybe even join us for an activity! https://www.meetup.com/makersnz-wgtn/

#### The Goal
We wanted to start a project that would bring local makers together. We ambitiously decided on turning an ultimaker original [plus] kit into a chocolate printer. This meant we could get to know each other and we figured it was sure to result in some yummy treats.

We are documenting this after the fact. While we're scrambling to play catch up have a look at some of the discussion [on the meetup forums](https://www.meetup.com/makersnz-wgtn/messages/boards/thread/49856617)  
We also have a very [messy google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bwhcg9j8_xowNTNCcG5oVEFyVFU?usp=sharing) but be warned its really messy
